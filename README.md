This is a version of the classic game Hangman. At the start of the game, the program will pull a randomly generated word with 5 or less characteers from an API.
The user must input letters to guess the word before the man is formed on the hangmans noose.
If a user unputs the same letter twice, the program will notify the user to select a different letter and it will not count as a turn.
At the end of the game, the program will anounce if you won or lost, and print the game word.
